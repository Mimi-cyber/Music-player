## Project Overview

This project is a simple web-based music player that allows users to play a playlist of songs. Users can control playback, switch between songs, and enjoy a rotating album cover image while listening to music. The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page. It includes the necessary elements for the music player, such as the audio player, control buttons, and album cover image.

- **style.css**: This CSS file provides the styling for the web page, including the layout, colors, and animations.

- **script.js**: The JavaScript file contains the functionality of the music player, such as handling play/pause, switching songs, and rotating the album cover image.

- **music/**: This directory contains the music files (in MP3 format) that make up the playlist. You can add more songs to this directory if desired.

- **image/**: This directory contains the album cover image. You can replace this image with the cover art of your choice.
